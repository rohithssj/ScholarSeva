🎓 ScholarSeva

A modern scholarship aggregator platform built to simplify the process of discovering government scholarships for students across India.

🚀 About The Project

ScholarSeva is an initiative to solve one of the most common problems students face — finding genuine and relevant scholarships without confusion.

I am a student from CMRIT College, and through this project, I aim to make scholarship discovery simple, structured, and accessible.

This platform is currently under development.
New verified scholarships will be added weekly to improve coverage and accuracy.
